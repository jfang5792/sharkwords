# Sharkwords Game

In ðŸ¦ˆ Sharkwords, a random word gets generated. The goal is to find what that word is by guessing the letters that might make up the word. If you guess a letter thatâ€™s not in the word, sharks will begin to circle you! If you make 5 wrong guesses, the sharks will attack!

## Install Dependencies & Run Server

If you downloaded our starter code into a new folder, you will need to create a new virtual environment, activate it, and install dependencies from <i>requirements.txt</i>:

```
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the server:

```
$ python3 server.py
```
